/**
 * Action Process Interface
 * 
 * The output gateway of cognition - executing decisions in the world.
 * Mirrors Sensation as the input gateway, completing the perception-action loop.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Motor Control Theory: From intention to execution
 *   (Wolpert & Ghahramani, 2000, "Computational Motor Control")
 * - Action-Perception Coupling: Actions shape what we perceive
 *   (Gibson, 1979, "The Ecological Approach")
 * - Embodied Cognition: Thinking through acting
 *   (Clark, 1997; Wilson, 2002)
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Action is the culmination of cognitive processing
 * - Deterministic execution of cognitive decisions
 * - In AI: tool usage, API calls, response generation
 * - Completes the cognitive loop: Sensation → Processing → Action
 * 
 * Implementation Note:
 * - Pure Computation substrate: deterministic execution
 * - Maps cognitive decisions to external effects
 * - Currently placeholder for future tool/API integration
