/**
 * Integration Stage Interface
 * 
 * Integrates new episodic experiences into existing cognitive maps,
 * updating personal knowledge structures and completing the cognitive cycle.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Cognitive Maps: "Mental representations of spatial and conceptual relationships"
 *   (Tolman, 1948; O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978, "The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map")
 * - Memory Consolidation: "Transfer from hippocampus to cortex over time"
 *   (Squire & Alvarez, 1995; Frankland & Bontempi, 2005)
 * - Schema Theory: "Integration of new information into existing knowledge"
 *   (Bartlett, 1932; Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014; van Kesteren et al., 2012)
 * - Complementary Learning Systems: "Fast hippocampal learning integrated
 *   with slow cortical learning" (McClelland et al., 1995; Kumaran et al., 2016)
 * 
 * Neuroscience Mechanisms:
 * - Systems Consolidation: Hippocampal-neocortical transfer
 *   (Dudai et al., 2015; Moscovitch et al., 2006)
 * - Schema-dependent Learning: vmPFC mediates rapid consolidation
 *   (Tse et al., 2007; van Kesteren et al., 2010)
 * - Memory Transformation: From episodic to semantic
 *   (Winocur et al., 2010; Robin & Moscovitch, 2017)
 * 
 * Design Implications:
 * - Generation because it creates new connections and meanings
 * - Updates both hippocampal indices and cortical schemas
 * - Completes the "experience→meaning→semantics→experience" cycle (Issue #12)
 * 
 * Critical Function: Enables learning and adaptation by updating
 * cognitive structures based on new experiences
