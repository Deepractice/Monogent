/**
 * Association Stage Interface
 * 
 * Performs hippocampal pattern completion to retrieve episodic memories
 * from partial cues. Core mechanism of associative memory retrieval.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Associative Memory: "The ability to learn and remember relationships
 *   between unrelated items" (Suzuki, 2007; Squire et al., 2004)
 * - Pattern Completion: "Retrieval of complete memories from partial cues"
 *   (Marr, 1971; McNaughton & Morris, 1987; O'Reilly & McClelland, 1994)
 * - Hippocampal CA3 Function: "Autoassociative network for pattern completion"
 *   (Rolls, 2013; Treves & Rolls, 1994)
 * - Complementary Learning Systems: "Fast learning in hippocampus,
 *   slow learning in cortex" (McClelland et al., 1995)
 * 
 * Neuroscience Evidence:
 * - CA3 Recurrent Collaterals: Enable autoassociation
 *   (Ishizuka et al., 1990; Li et al., 1994)
 * - Dentate Gyrus → CA3: Pattern separation before completion
 *   (Leutgeb et al., 2007; Yassa & Stark, 2011)
 * - Sharp Wave Ripples: Replay and consolidation
 *   (Buzsáki, 2015, "Hippocampal sharp wave-ripple")
 * 
 * Design Decision:
 * - Computation because pattern completion is deterministic
 * - Does NOT require semantic understanding, just pattern matching
 * - Hippocampus as implicit component (biological constraint)
 * 
 * Potential Enhancement: Consider pattern separation preprocessing?
