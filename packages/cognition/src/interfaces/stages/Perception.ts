/**
 * Perception Stage Interface
 * 
 * Organizes and interprets sensory signals into coherent perceptual objects.
 * Involves higher-level cortical areas for pattern recognition and interpretation.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Gestalt Principles: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
 *   (Wertheimer, 1923; Koffka, 1935; KÃ¶hler, 1947)
 * - Two-streams Hypothesis: Ventral "what" and dorsal "where" pathways
 *   (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982; Goodale & Milner, 1992)
 * - Predictive Processing: "Perception as Bayesian inference"
 *   (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Clark, 2013; Hohwy, 2013)
 * - Object Recognition: IT cortex and hierarchical processing
 *   (Tanaka, 1996; DiCarlo et al., 2012)
 * 
 * Design Rationale:
 * - Implemented as Generation because perception involves:
 *   1. Top-down predictions (requires cortical/LLM processing)
 *   2. Interpretation beyond mere feature detection
 *   3. Context-dependent processing
 * - Accepts Sensation object to maintain processing context
 * 
 * Potential Issue: Should we handle binding problem explicitly?
 * (Treisman & Gelade, 1980, Feature Integration Theory)
