/**
 * Attention Stage Interface
 * 
 * Selects and enhances relevant information while suppressing irrelevant information.
 * Acts as the cognitive system's gatekeeper and resource allocator.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Filter Theory: "Attention as information bottleneck"
 *   (Broadbent, 1958, "Perception and Communication")
 * - Attenuation Theory: "Attention as signal enhancement/suppression"
 *   (Treisman, 1964, "Selective Attention in Man")
 * - Attention Networks: "Three networks: alerting, orienting, executive"
 *   (Posner & Petersen, 1990, "The Attention System of the Human Brain")
 * - Biased Competition: "Attention biases competition among stimuli"
 *   (Desimone & Duncan, 1995, "Neural Mechanisms of Selective Visual Attention")
 * 
 * Neuroscience Basis:
 * - Thalamus: Gateway and early filtering (thalamic reticular nucleus)
 *   (Sherman & Guillery, 2006, "Exploring the Thalamus")
 * - Frontal-Parietal Network: Top-down attention control
 *   (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002, "Control of Goal-Directed and Stimulus-Driven Attention")
 * - Pulvinar: Attention coordination across cortical areas
 *   (Saalmann & Kastner, 2011, "Cognitive and Perceptual Functions of the Visual Thalamus")
 * 
 * Design Decision:
 * - Implemented as Computation (deterministic selection based on salience)
 * - Can be placed at multiple stages in cognitive pipeline
 * - Early attention: After sensation (thalamic gating)
 * - Late attention: After perception (cortical selection)
