/**
 * Sensation Stage Interface
 * 
 * The entry point of cognition that transduces physical stimuli into neural signals.
 * Represents the initial, pre-attentive processing of sensory information.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Transduction: "The conversion of physical energy into neural signals" 
 *   (Goldstein, 2010, "Sensation and Perception", 8th ed.)
 * - Bottom-up Processing: "Data-driven processing based on incoming sensory data"
 *   (Gibson, 1979, "The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception")
 * - Primary Sensory Cortices: V1, A1, S1 for visual, auditory, somatosensory
 *   (Kandel et al., 2013, "Principles of Neural Science", 5th ed.)
 * 
 * Characteristics:
 * - Automatic and involuntary (Kahneman, 2011, "Thinking, Fast and Slow")
 * - Modality-specific processing
 * - High temporal resolution, low semantic content
 * - Implemented as Computation due to deterministic nature
