/**
 * Representation Stage Interface
 * 
 * Transforms perceptual output into structured symbolic representation.
 * Creates abstract, language-ready formats suitable for conceptual processing.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Dual Coding Theory: "Cognition involves two distinct subsystems:
 *   verbal (language) and non-verbal (imagery)" (Paivio, 1971, 1986)
 * - Propositional Representation: "Mental representations as abstract,
 *   language-like structures" (Anderson, 1983, ACT-R theory)
 * - Conceptual Structure: "From percepts to concepts" 
 *   (Barsalou, 1999, "Perceptual Symbol Systems")
 * - Symbol Grounding: "How semantic symbols get their meaning"
 *   (Harnad, 1990, "The Symbol Grounding Problem")
 * 
 * Neuroscience Basis:
 * - Angular Gyrus: Cross-modal integration and conceptualization
 *   (Seghier, 2013, "The Angular Gyrus: Multiple Functions")
 * - Left Hemisphere Language Areas: Broca's and Wernicke's areas
 *   (Friederici, 2011, "The Brain Basis of Language Processing")
 * 
 * Design Decision:
 * - Generation because it requires cortical/LLM semantic processing
 * - Bridges perceptual and conceptual processing
 * - Prepares for AMR-like structured representations (Issue #10)
