/**
 * Discrimination Stage Interface
 * 
 * Detects differences between stimuli and establishes boundaries for perception.
 * Acts as a pre-classifier to prevent perceptual confusion.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Signal Detection Theory: "Discriminating signal from noise"
 *   (Green & Swets, 1966, "Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics")
 * - Weber-Fechner Law: "Just noticeable difference proportional to stimulus"
 *   (Weber, 1834; Fechner, 1860, "Elements of Psychophysics")
 * - Feature Detection: "Neurons as feature detectors"
 *   (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962, "Receptive fields in striate cortex")
 * - Categorical Perception: "Discrimination at category boundaries"
 *   (Liberman et al., 1957, "The discrimination of speech sounds")
 * 
 * Neuroscience Basis:
 * - Primary Sensory Cortices: Feature-specific neurons
 *   - V1: Orientation, edge detection (simple/complex cells)
 *   - A1: Frequency discrimination (tonotopic organization)
 *   - S1: Two-point discrimination (somatotopic map)
 * - Lateral Inhibition: Enhances contrast and boundaries
 *   (Hartline & Ratliff, 1957, "Inhibitory interaction in the retina")
 * 
 * Key Functions:
 * - Boundary Detection: Finding edges and transitions
 * - Contrast Enhancement: Making differences more salient
 * - Feature Extraction: Identifying discriminative features
 * - Categorical Boundaries: Establishing perceptual categories
 * 
 * Design Decision:
 * - Implemented as Computation (deterministic feature detection)
 * - Positioned between sensation and perception
 * - Prevents perceptual confusion by pre-classifying signals
