/**
 * Apperception Interface - The Unity of Consciousness
 * 
 * Represents the highest cognitive act of unifying sensible intuition (Origin)
 * with intellectual understanding (Function) under the unity of consciousness.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Kant's Transcendental Apperception: "The I think must be able to accompany all my representations"
 *   (Kant, 1781, "Critique of Pure Reason", B131-132)
 * - Unity of Apperception: "The transcendental unity of self-consciousness"
 *   (Kant, CPR, B132)
 * - Leibniz's Apperception: "The consciousness or reflective knowledge of perception"
 *   (Leibniz, 1714, "Monadology", ยง14)
 * 
 * Cognitive Psychology:
 * - Apperception: "The process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience"
 *   (Herbart, 1834; Wundt, 1896)
 * - Modern Definition: Integration of new information into existing cognitive structures
 *   (Bruner, 1957; Neisser, 1967)
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Apperception is the highest form of Evolution
 * - Unifies sensibility (Process) and understanding (Function)
 * - Like Computation has elaborate(), Apperception has apperceive()
 * - Represents the "I think" that accompanies all cognition
 * 
 * Three-Layer Mapping:
 * - Process = Sensibility (Sinnlichkeit) - organizing raw materials
 * - Function = Understanding (Verstand) - applying concepts
 * - Apperception = Reason (Vernunft) - unifying under self-consciousness
