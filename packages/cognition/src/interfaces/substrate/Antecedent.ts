/**
 * Antecedent Type - The Precondition of Cognitive Experience
 * 
 * Represents the triggering condition that initiates a cognitive process.
 * Can be external stimuli or internal cognitive products.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - ABC Model: "Antecedent → Behavior → Consequence"
 *   (Ellis, 1962; Skinner, 1953)
 * - Cognitive Antecedents: "Prior conditions that trigger cognitive processing"
 *   (Beck, 1976; Lazarus, 1991)
 * - Dual-Route Models: "External and internal antecedents to cognition"
 *   (Paivio, 1986, "Dual Coding Theory")
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Antecedents are the causal precursors to cognitive events
 * - Can be external (stimuli) or internal (thoughts, memories)
 * - Type alias allows flexibility in what can trigger cognition
 * - Emphasizes the causal relationship in cognitive chains
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - External: sensory stimuli, environmental events
 * - Internal: thoughts, memories, emotions, intentions
