/**
 * Generation Substrate Interface
 * 
 * Creative evolution - semantic unfolding of cognitive processes.
 * Represents transformations that are interpretive and generative.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Generative Linguistics: "Infinite use of finite means"
 *   (Chomsky, 1965, "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax")
 * - Type 2 Processing: "Slow, sequential, conscious, controlled"
 *   (Evans & Stanovich, 2013, "Dual-Process Theories")
 * - Creative Cognition: "Generation of novel and useful ideas"
 *   (Finke et al., 1992, "Creative Cognition")
 * 
 * Neuroscience Basis:
 * - Default Mode Network: Creative idea generation
 *   (Beaty et al., 2016, "Creative Cognition and Brain Network Dynamics")
 * - Language Areas: Broca's and Wernicke's for semantic processing
 *   (Hagoort, 2013, "MUC (Memory, Unification, Control)")
 * 
 * Design Principles:
 * - Extends Evolution with asynchronous, creative behavior
 * - Leverages LLM capabilities for semantic understanding
 * - Generation is the "creative unfolding" of evolution
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - Pattern interpretation, meaning construction, narrative generation
 * - Concept formation, metaphor creation, insight generation
 * - Language production, creative problem solving, hypothesis formation
