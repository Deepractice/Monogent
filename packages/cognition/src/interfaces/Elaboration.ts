/**
 * Elaboration Interface - Meta-Evolution
 * 
 * The highest-order Evolution that orchestrates the unfolding of cognition
 * through multiple stages. It is the "evolution of evolutions."
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Elaborative Processing: "The process of adding meaning and associations
 *   to information" (Craik & Lockhart, 1972, "Levels of Processing")
 * - Global Workspace Theory: Shared context for cognitive processes
 *   (Baars, 1988; Dehaene & Naccache, 2001)
 * - Process Philosophy: "Actual entities are drops of experience"
 *   (Whitehead, 1929, "Process and Reality")
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Elaboration is a meta-process that evolves through sub-evolutions
 * - Each cognitive stage is a step in the elaboration's evolution
 * - Context accumulates as elaboration unfolds through stages
 * - The final state emerges from the composition of all sub-evolutions
 * 
 * Functional Programming Perspective:
 * - Elaboration as Monad: carries context through transformations
 * - Cognitive pipeline as function composition
 * - Lazy evaluation until final execution
