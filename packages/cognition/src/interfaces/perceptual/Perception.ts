/**
 * Perception Function Interface
 * 
 * Organizes sensory signals into meaningful perceptual experiences.
 * Pure Generation substrate - creative, interpretive, context-dependent.
 * 
 * Theoretical Foundation:
 * - Gestalt Psychology: "The whole is greater than the sum of parts"
 *   (Wertheimer, 1923; Koffka, 1935; KÃ¶hler, 1947)
 * - Feature Integration Theory: Binding features into objects
 *   (Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Treisman, 1996)
 * - Predictive Processing: Perception as inference
 *   (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Clark, 2013; Hohwy, 2013)
 * 
 * Composes:
 * 1. Sensation: Receive and transduce sensory signals
 * 2. SensoryGating: Filter relevant sensory information  
 * 3. FeatureDetection: Extract basic features (with LLM interpretation)
 * 4. PatternRecognition: Form perceptual wholes
