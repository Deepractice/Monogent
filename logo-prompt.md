# Monogent Logo Generation Prompt

## Main Prompt

Create a logo design featuring a single face split vertically down the middle, where the left half represents Democritus (ancient Greek philosopher of materialism) and the right half represents Plato (ancient Greek philosopher of idealism). 

**Style**: Modern minimalist design with philosophical depth, suitable for an AI technology brand

**Composition**:
- Single face divided perfectly down the center vertical line
- Left side: Democritus (materialism/physical world)
- Right side: Plato (idealism/world of forms)
- The division line should be a glowing neural network pattern representing AI

**Left Half (Democritus - Materialism)**:
- Ancient Greek male features with a more pragmatic, observational expression
- Background elements: atomic orbital patterns, binary code (0s and 1s) flowing downward
- Color scheme: Cool blues and cyans, silver metallic tones
- Texture: Circuit board patterns subtly integrated into the skin/beard

**Right Half (Plato - Idealism)**:
- Ancient Greek male features with a contemplative, transcendent expression
- Background elements: Platonic solids (geometric shapes), rays of golden light emanating outward
- Color scheme: Warm golds and oranges, ethereal glows
- Texture: Sacred geometry patterns subtly integrated

**Central Integration**:
- The dividing line should be a vertical neural network with synapses
- Where the two halves meet, create a subtle gradient blend
- Small AI circuit nodes along the division line connecting both sides

**Typography**:
- Below the face: "MONOGENT" in modern, clean sans-serif font
- Subtitle in smaller text: "AI Individual Cognitive System"
- Font color: Gradient from blue (left) to gold (right)

**Overall Mood**: 
- Philosophical and technological
- Ancient wisdom meets modern AI
- The eternal debate between matter and mind unified through artificial intelligence

**Technical Requirements**:
- Square format (1:1 ratio)
- High contrast for icon usage
- Works well in both color and monochrome
- Scalable from favicon (16x16) to large display (512x512)

## Alternative Simplified Prompt

A logo showing one face split vertically - left half is Democritus with atomic symbols and binary code in blue tones, right half is Plato with geometric shapes and golden light. The dividing line is a glowing AI neural network. Modern minimalist style. Text below: "MONOGENT"
