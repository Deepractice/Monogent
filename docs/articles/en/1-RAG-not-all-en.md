# Why RAG Isn't All You Need for AI Memory

#### The Essence of RAG

**Conclusion: RAG is a retrieval method that sacrifices information precision for broader matching space. The sacrificed precision is the semantic richness (semantic loss[1]).**

In principle, RAG works by converting text into vectors and finding "relevant" content through similarity calculations. During this process, rich semantic information is compressed into fixed-dimensional numbers, flattening subtle meaning differences.

All issues encountered in the industry stem from this semantic loss, such as:

- Widening the Semantic Gap [2]
- Low recall and hit rates, impacting practical applications [3]
- Context loss: Document chunking leads to missing key contextual information [3]
- Scalability challenges: More documents worsen vector retrieval accuracy [3]
- Difficulty distinguishing similar documents: High-similarity docs are hard to differentiate [3]

For example, storing "I like eating strawberries" might retrieve "I like" first, then through multi-path recall find "I like eating grass," leading AI to conclude the user likes eating grass. This is a classic hallucination mechanism: fragmented retrieval plus erroneous splicing.

So, can this information loss truly be mitigated through technical improvements?

#### Why RAG's Problems Can't Be Solved by Improving RAG

**Conclusion: Computation can never replicate semantic properties. This isn't an engineering issue but a philosophical divide.**

Philosopher John Searle's "Chinese Room" thought experiment reveals this fundamental problem [4]:

Imagine a person who doesn't understand Chinese in a room with a detailed manual for processing Chinese symbols. When Chinese questions are slipped under the door, they follow the rules to find and output corresponding symbol combinations. To outsiders, it seems they "understand" Chinese, but they're just mechanically following symbol conversion rules, with no grasp of the meaning.

This exposes an ontological divide:

| Computation/RAG World (Material) | Cognitive World (Ideal) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Symbols | Meanings |
| Vectors | Concepts |
| Algorithms | Understanding |
| Data | Experiences |

Stevan Harnad's "Symbol Grounding Problem" [5] further illustrates: Imagine learning Chinese from a dictionary where all explanations are in Chinese. Looking up "horse" gives "a type of animal"; "animal" gives "a type of living being"... Symbols only point to other symbols, never reaching true meaning.

This is an ontological gap:
- Computation is a physical process following causality
- Meaning is a mental phenomenon in the realm of consciousness
- The former is objective, measurable, deterministic
- The latter is subjective, experiential, emergent

No matter how RAG is improved, it can't bridge this gap—like the most precise camera can't capture "beauty" itself, only the objects carrying beauty.

But does this mean RAG is useless?

#### What Is RAG Truly Suited For?

**Conclusion: RAG is an excellent information retrieval tool, but not a cognitive system.**

RAG is highly valuable for public information retrieval, much like search engines for humans—we don't directly apply search results but use our brains for analysis, reasoning, and learning. AI should do the same: Use RAG for external info retrieval, and a true memory system for cognitive processing.

Specifically, RAG suits:
- Knowledge Q&A (fact-finding)
- Document assistance (locating relevant passages in large docs)
- As AI's "external reference book"

The key distinction: Retrieval finds information; cognition understands it. The former is RAG's domain, the latter needs a true cognitive system.

So, what does true AI memory require?

#### What Does AI Memory Need?

**Conclusion: True AI memory requires preserving semantic integrity, understanding conceptual relationships, and supporting personalized organization.**

Unlike RAG's fragmented storage, a true memory system needs:
- **Semantic Integrity**: "I like eating strawberries" as a complete cognitive unit
- **Structured Relationships**: Understanding "strawberries" as the object, avoiding erroneous splits
- **Personalized Organization**: Each AI has its unique semantic network
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Cognitive structures develop with accumulated experiences

This raises the core question: How to build a true AI individual cognitive system?

#### Monogent: AI Individual Cognitive System

Just as human children start from shared language and gradually form unique thinking patterns, AI needs such a development process. This isn't simple information storage but the construction and evolution of cognitive structures.

Monogent (AI Individual Cognitive System) is designed to solve this. What we need isn't better retrieval algorithms, but true understanding of:
- What is memory
- What is thinking
- What is knowledge
- What is experience
- What is learning
- What is innovation
- What is cognition
- What is **individuality**

In upcoming articles, we'll delve deeper into these questions.
